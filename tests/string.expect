This is a "string" atom, use the double quote (") character to create string atom.
Use the handy back-slash (\) character to prevent the lexer from capturing it.
For instance, \" escapes the " character and \\ escapes the \ character.
You also do not need to worry about characters like "(", ")" or ";",
the lexer will not capture them.
You can use the str? predicate to test if an s-expression is a string or not.
For example: (str? "") will yield:
#t
Similarly: (str? 1) will yield:
#f
